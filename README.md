# MovieService API

## Overview
The `Cinema API` is a RESTful web service for managing a collection of movies.
 It allows clients to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on movie data,
 as well as update the availability status of a movie.
 The API is built using Spring Boot and offers endpoints for retrieving all movies,
 fetching a movie by its ID, adding a new movie, updating an existing movie, deleting a movie, and setting a movie's availability.
